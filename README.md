## 🔊 Reverb Compass
**This mod adds a new item that allows the player to recall themselves back to a connected lodestone. This mod aims to add waypoints, but balanced around a vanilla-esque mechanic.**

Craft a reverb compass by crafting a lodestone compass and an echo shard. Use the reverb compass to recall yourself back on top of the lodestone that the compass is linked to for a quick option for travel!
